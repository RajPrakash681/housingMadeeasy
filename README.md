🏡 HousingMadeEasy
<p align="center"> <img src="assets/housing_banner.png" width="600"/> </p>

HousingMadeEasy is a modern, mobile-first real estate & hotel booking platform built with React Native, Expo, and Appwrite. Designed for seamless property discovery, management, and engagement, the app empowers buyers, travelers, and agents with an intuitive, production-ready experience.

🚀 Why HousingMadeEasy Stands Out

✅ Instant Mock Data Fallback – Never see a blank screen! The app shows realistic mock property/hotel data even if the backend is down.
✅ Appwrite-Powered – Real-time database, secure authentication, file storage, and more.
✅ Google OAuth2 Login – Fast and secure authentication flow.
✅ Mobile-First UX – Optimized for both iOS & Android with a native feel.
✅ Smart Error Handling – Graceful fallbacks with clear user-friendly messages.
✅ Extensible Codebase – Modular architecture ready for scaling or feature expansion.
✅ Demo-Ready Anytime – Works offline with mock data, perfect for live presentations.

🧑‍💻 My Learning Journey

Building HousingMadeEasy taught me:

How a mobile-first architecture is designed from scratch.

Integration of a real-time backend (Appwrite) with React Native.

Implementing Google OAuth2 login in mobile apps.

Structuring apps with modular, reusable components.

Handling API errors gracefully with mock data fallbacks.

Designing a production-ready UI/UX optimized for both iOS & Android.

The end-to-end development cycle: idea → UI design → backend setup → deployment.

This project gave me confidence in full-stack mobile app development, preparing me for real-world products and scaling ideas to production.
