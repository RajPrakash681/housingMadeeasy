Welcome to **HousingMadeEasy** – a modern, mobile-first real estate platform built with React Native, Expo, and Appwrite. This project is designed to make property discovery, management, and engagement seamless for both buyers and agents.

## 🚀 Why HousingMadeEasy Stands Out

- **Instant Mock Data Fallback:** Never see a blank screen! Even if your backend is down or not yet configured, the app displays realistic mock property data, ensuring a smooth demo and development experience.
- **Appwrite-Powered:** Secure, scalable, and open-source backend with real-time database, authentication, file storage, and more.
- **OAuth2 Google Login:** Fast, secure sign-in with Google using Expo and Appwrite.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Clean, well-typed codebase with clear separation of concerns. Easily add new features or swap out backend providers.
- **Mobile-First UX:** Built with React Native and Expo for blazing-fast performance and native feel on both Android and iOS.
- **Smart Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks and clear error messages keep users informed and engaged, not frustrated.
- **Ready for Production:** Environment variables, authentication, and database queries are all set up for real-world deployment.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/RajPrakash681/housingMadeeasy.git
    cd housingMadeeasy
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure Environment**
    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Appwrite credentials.
    - Or use Expo’s `app.config.js` for public environment variables.

4. **Run the App**
    ```sh
    npx expo start
    ```

5. **(Optional) Seed Appwrite Database**
    - Set up your Appwrite collections and indexes as described in `/docs/SETUP.md`.
    - Or just use the app with mock data for instant demo!

## 🧠 How This Gives You an Edge

- **Always Demo-Ready:** Show off your app anywhere, anytime—even without a backend!
- **Developer Friendly:** No more cryptic errors or blank screens; everything is handled gracefully.
- **Easy to Extend:** Add new property types, agents, or features with minimal code changes.
- **Modern Stack:** Uses the latest in Expo, React Native, and Appwrite for a future-proof foundation.
- **Open Source:** Contribute, fork, or use as a starter for your next big idea.
